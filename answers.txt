Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows people to efficiently manage version control of a codebase. We can collaborate with others, track changes, and revert to different versions if needed. It allows developers to work remotely on different features of a product simultaneously and merge them together, which is ideal in the software development lifecycle.
